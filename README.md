# The-Cash-Game

**--ARCHIVED--**

The Cash Game is a simple game where you try to balance the amounts in each node by taking money or giving to all attached nodes.

This repository implements The Cash Game through mainly Object-Oriented Javascript with a HTML and CSS.



The project was created on a whim the night before a ski-trip so my friends and I would have something to play on the bus ride there. It is far from perfect but can provide a few minutes of fun and a decent challenge. 



## Development / Testing

The game was written in HTML so that it can be opened in Google Chrome and run. If you wish to continue development, simple clone or download the repository and open "main.html" in Google Chrome (Other web browsers may work but aren't necessarily supported).

"app.html" is a "compiled" version of "main.html", "script.js" and "style.css" into one file so that it could be opened and run on a smartphone. (You may have to request the "desktop version" of the file when opening it on smartphone for proper styling)

For a quick example or to play for yourself, simply download "app.html" and open it in Chrome.
